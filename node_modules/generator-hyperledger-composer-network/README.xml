<title>What is this generator about?</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">hyperledger-composer-network</emphasis> is all about getting started quickly. Running this generator will build a simple network for Hyperledger Composer. Better than just a boilerplate, the generated file is already tuned with your name, etc&#8230;</simpara>
<simpara>Read on a give a try.</simpara>

<title>What is Yeoman?</title>
<simpara>Trick question. It&#8217;s not a thing. It&#8217;s this guy:</simpara>

<simpara>Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.</simpara>
<simpara>Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](<ulink url="https://npmjs.org">https://npmjs.org</ulink>) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. <emphasis role="strong">Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>```bash
npm install -g yo
```</simpara>

<title>Yeoman Generators</title>
<simpara>Yeoman travels light. He didn&#8217;t pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.</simpara>
<simpara>To install hyperledger-composer-network from npm, run:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="subs="attributes+">npm install -g {proj}</programlisting>
<simpara>Finally, initiate the generator:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="subs="attributes+">yo {proj}</programlisting>

<title>Getting To Know Yeoman</title>
<simpara>Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#8217;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#8217;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#8217;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;d like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](<ulink url="http://gruntjs.com">http://gruntjs.com</ulink>) and [Bower](<ulink url="http://bower.io">http://bower.io</ulink>), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](<ulink url="https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started">https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started</ulink>).</simpara>
