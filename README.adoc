This business network defines the following models:

To test this Business Network Definition in the **Test** tab:

Create a `SampleParticipant` participant:

  {
    "$class": "org.car.carauction.SampleParticipant",
    "participantId": "Toby",
    "firstName": "Tobias",
    "lastName": "Hunter"
  }

Create a `SampleAsset` asset:

  {
    "$class": "org.car.carauction.SampleAsset",
    "assetId": "assetId:1",
    "owner": "resource:org.car.carauction.SampleParticipant#Toby",
    "value": "original value"
  }

Submit a `SampleTransaction` transaction:

  {
    "$class": "org.car.carauction.SampleTransaction",
    "asset": "resource:org.car.carauction.SampleAsset#assetId:1",
    "newValue": "new value"
  }

After submitting this transaction, you should now see the transaction in the Transaction Registry and that a `SampleEvent` has been emitted. As a result, the value of the `assetId:1` should now be `new value` in the Asset Registry.

Congratulations!
